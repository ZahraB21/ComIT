# ComIT

This is a case study for ComIT organization. I have developed a simple website for them 
with the use of HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, Font Awesome. 

The web page is fully responsive, allowing it to be user friendly in various screen devices such as mobile, laptop and desktop devices. I have chosen Bootstrap to assist me with this regard. 

I am using SASS which would allow me to use Mixins, Include and Import all which are crucial to clean, better and faster styling.

To add the icons such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn I have used Font Awesome for this purpose.
